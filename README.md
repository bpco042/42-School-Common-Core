## Study Practices

Beyond the collaborative work with peers, I used the following methods for studying:
- **AI**: Using artificial intelligence as a teacher can make the learning process more friendly. However, it should not be used to copy and paste code. Instead, it‚Äôs highly recommended to treat AI as a research reference, error checker, syntax verifier, implementation suggester, and ‚Äî only as a last resort ‚Äî code provider.

  When you're stuck on an exercise and can't develop a solution on your own, ask for help to understand the problem, structure the required steps, and maybe get help with pseudocode. The key is to use AI strictly as a **support tool** to enhance your learning as projects become more complex.

  For EVERY suggestion used, you must understand the concepts, rewrite in your own way, and most importantly, NEVER copy. Transcribe, rewrite, understand, adapt, ask, break the code down in detail, question every nuance, and conclude by confirming your understanding with the AI. It's amazing to witness the evolution in the depth of the questions you start asking over time ‚Äî simple questions evolve into more complex ones, reflecting a broader understanding of the interworking parts.

- **Code Review**: When writing code, I avoid commenting in the first phase. I complete the task, check the syntax and functionality, and only then revisit the code to patiently comment line by line on what was implemented and why. This helps clarify many things and reinforces concepts.

- **Documentation Search**: During the exercise analysis and solution creation phase, I rely on every available source to gather useful information ‚Äî Google, Stack Overflow, and language documentation sites are great for this.

- **Extra Exercises and Practice Tests**: Another strategy I use is practicing with extra exercises (outside the school's content) and mock exams found online. Focused practice has helped me in the past (e.g., studying for civil service exams), and proves very effective at 42 School too.

These are some of the methods I use, but this is by no means an exhaustive list ‚Äî study approaches should always be adapted to fit your personal style. However, one GENERAL RULE stands out: **time management is a crucial skill to learn and master**.
